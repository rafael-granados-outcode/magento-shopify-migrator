And here’s why:</P><P>If you do a lot of sport climbing a solid gate design makes sense. Bolt hangers can be very unforgiving of lightweight biners, particularly if you are dogging about and taking repeated redpoint falls.</P><P>The Alpha Pro is robust and strong enough to cope with the typical sport climbing scenarios, but what really makes it stand out from the crowd is its exceptional handling qualities.</P><P>The distinctive shape of the carabiner is no accident. The kinked back bone and grippy groove pattern on the apex of the spine are there for a reason. These biners are very easy to handle – something we are certain you will appreciate when stretching up to make that just-in-reach, gripper clip.</P><P>Top tip: You should always try to clip bolts or pegs with the same end of the quickdraw. The reason being that a fall can cause the bolt hanger to gouge out a small, but sharp edged groove in the rope basket of the biner. If you then switch to clipping your rope through the same biner you will probably damage the sheath if you fall off.</P><LI>Strength (Gate Open) : 9 kn <LI>Strength (Gate Closed) : 24 kn <LI>Strength (Minor Axis) : 8 kn <LI>Gate Openning : 22mm <LI>Weight: 44 g</LI>","DMM-0203","12.5000","9.3800","0.0800","Climbing","Climbing, Carabiners, Non-Locking, Carabiners, DMM ","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm-0203_1.jpg","19","1","0","DMM Alpha Sport Straight Gate Carabiner","0","2230","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm-0203_1.jpg","DMM Alpha Sport Straight Gate Carabiner","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm-0203_1.jpg","DMM Alpha Sport Straight Gate Carabiner","dmm-alpha-sport-straight-gate-carabiner-eb9cd7",,,,,,,,,

"DMM Belay Master 2 Locking Carabiner","dmm-belay-master-2-locking-carabiner","<p>Totally redesigned, the ever popular Belay Master continues to set standards for safety and design. The Belay Master is a tweaked version of the DMM Fat Boy HMS with a patented integral plastic clip that together increase the overall safety of the belay system. The clip can only be locked into place when the screwgate barrel is tightened into the locked position, thus providing a failsafe check that the biner is closed securely. The plastic clip also stops the Karabiner from rotating in the belay system and being cross-loaded. The Belay Master is a mid-sized HMS with a large rope radius and soft angles on the top bar.

Ever since we came out with this design in 1997, it's set the bar pretty high for this type of product. To start with, its shape orients the load predictably where we want it every time. Other belay carabiners can be loaded on the spine, like they were intended, or sometimes, closer to the nose of the 'biner à where they're decidedly weaker. The Jake eliminated this problem through a superior design, so that it's always loaded along its strongest axis. It also centers your belay/rappel device so that in double rope rappels, neither strand of rope is pinched on the spine, ensuring a smooth and predictable rap'. This won't leave you with uneven lengths of rope at the bottom, due to friction on only one strand. <p>The Jake is also equipped with a truly unique side-swing gate which provides you with greater gate clearance and ease of use.

Then when you clip it in something it will lock. Or, if you put it in a bolt hanger, tripod head, etc., and hold the sleeve when closing it will remain unlocked. Then you can turn the biner over and install a rope, pulley, etc., just like it was a non-locker, but when the gate snaps shut it will be locked. When climbing something sketchy, do you ever want to use a locker for your first placement? Use it for the bottom biner in a quickdraw and you can simply put the rope in and it will lock when it closes.Who can use it?The ORCA is very versatile but it is not like any other carabiner and you must understand how it works.

The Titan is designed with a double buckle swami for a wide range of adjustment, allowing the gear loops to be centered and symmetrical throughout the size range. <P>With six big gear loops, the Titan provides plenty of on-harness racking, and the cambered shape prevents slippage. The tie-in points are reinforced with abrasion resistant nylon tubular webbing, and the 6,000 lb. belay/rappel loop is wide for easy access. <P>Padded with bilayer foam, the Titan has wide inner layers which distribute forces over 3 times more surface area. Leg loops are adjustable and removeable, helping you to sleep securely and comfortably on a ledge while still anchored in.

"CAMP Nano 23 Carabiner","camp-nano-23-carabiner","<p>The lightest carabiner in the world! CAMP has achieved carabiner perfection by taking away everything possible while maintaining the safety and performance standards of the world's most technical climbers. The wire gate has good clipping action and clearance. The Nano 23 is an excellent choice for alpine and trad climbing where reductions in weight can realistically increase the chances for success. The Nano 23 is also ideal for anchoring at the top of sport climbs because the nose gets into and out of chains without snagging.</p> <p><strong>SPECS:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Weight: 23 g, 0.8 oz</li> <li>Major Axis: 20 kN</li> <li>Minor Axis: 7 kN</li> <li>Open Gate: 7 kN</li> <li>Gate Opening: 21 mm</li> </ul>","CMP-0159-Green","6.9500","5.2100","0.0500","Climbing","Climbing, Carabiners, Non-Locking, CAMP , Trifecta Sale","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/c/m/cmp-0096_2.jpg","19","1","1","CAMP Nano 23 Carabiner",,,"4","2","1","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/c/m/cmp-0096_2.jpg","CAMP Nano 23 Carabiner","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/c/m/cmp-0096_2.jpg","CAMP Nano 23 Carabiner","camp-nano-23-carabiner",,"Color",,,,,,,

It’s always better to have something, however small, between you and the ground.<P>IMP stands for Immaculate Marginal Protection – a neat little acronym, but one which fits perfectly.<P>IMP runners can never be considered as ‘trainstoppers’, at least not in the same way that a well placed Wallnut might be. But they can give unexpected holding power in marginal placements, particularly if you cluster the placements and equalise them so that the load is spread evenly.<P>We’ve given them a special aluminium swage which holds the wires parallel but allows one wire to slide. This means the nut is loaded more evenly on both sides. The swage is colour coded too, so you’ll always pick the right one.","DMM-0219-Full set","109.9500","82.4600","0.1140","Climbing","Climbing","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm-0007_1.jpg","54","1","0",,,"2230","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm-0007_1.jpg",,"2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm-0007_1.jpg",,"dmm-i-m-p-brass-micro-nut-full-set",,,,,,,,,

Their popularity is because their unique shape allows climbers to protect pitches that are otherwise not viable.<P>The finished product took longer to bring to market than predicted, but we had to completely rethink the manufacturing process whilst also maintaining the original design specification. The units are are manufactured from a very specific quality of 'brass' that is silver soldered onto stainless steel wire.<P>Every unit is proof loaded to 75% of its rated strength. <P>The wires benefit from a colour coded alloy swage that is only dinked on one side i.e. one wire runs free so that the head is always loaded optimally.

"Valandre Split-S Women's Jacket Black - Small","valandre-split-s-women's-jacket-black-small","<P>Built on a technological foundation earned from years of making expedition gear, the Split-S represents a leap forward in down jacket technology.</P><P>To start, we mimicked the natural bend of the human elbow, and cut the fabric of the sleeve to follow. This makes for a more comfortable fit and removes any creases that may compress the down.</P><P>The area between the arm and torso typically suffers from the arms motion pushing the down away from the torso and inner sleeve – Valandré solved this by adding two vertical compartments on the body side and three on the inner sleeve. These compartments keep the down in place and keep you warm.</P><P>We eliminated the connection seam at the shoulder by designing a single piece of fabric from the front to the back. By removing this connection seam, we removed the main point where water leaks into jackets.</P><P>All curves and stitches, are perfectly alligned, adding harmony and perfection to the style (Valandre - Jäger Style) . And the Split-S was form fitted into a mens and womens version.</P><P>And finally, at the top of the jacket, the fully zipped high collar moulds perfectly around your neck, providing duvet-like comfort.</P><P>The Split S mixes 32 technical compartments with ""French style (Jäger Style)"".

"La Sportiva Miura Lace-up Climbing Shoe","la-sportiva-miura-lace-up-climbing-shoe","<p>The La Sportiva Miura Climbing Shoe is one of the most well loved and popularly used climbing shoes in existence and there is many a reason why. These shoes were built on one of the most successful lasts of any ever built which has made them fit more types of feet than most any other climbing shoe. These shoes smear where other shoes wouldn&rsquo;t fathom, edge on dicey crystal nubs, and hook those pockets when things get inverted. The shoe is lined with Dentex and has speed lacing to provide precision fitting and has Vibram XS Grip rubber compound to keep that coefficient of static friction high (physics&hellip; sounds nerdy but it works). So when you need a shoe to crank out the tough stuff with a good level of security and comfort, look to the La Sportiva Miura.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>COLOR: Yellow/Black</li> <li>UPPER: Leather</li> <li>CONSTRUCTION: Slip Lasted</li> <li>LAST: PD75</li> <li>LINING: Dentex</li> <li>SOLE: 4mm Vibram XS Grip</li> <li>MIDSOLE: 1.1mm Laspoflex (forefoot only)</li> <li>WEIGHT: 8.22 oz/233 gm ""</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class=""ui-size-chart-table-wrap""> <table class=""sizing_chart data-table"" style=""width: 759px; height: 400px;""><caption>Sizing Chart:</caption> <tbody> <tr class=""cols4""><th>US MEN</th><th>EU</th><th>US WOMEN</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4</td> <td>35.5</td> <td>5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4.5</td> <td>36</td> <td>5.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4.5+</td> <td>36.5</td> <td>5.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>5</td> <td>37</td> <td>6</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>5.5</td> <td>37.5</td> <td>6.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6</td> <td>38</td> <td>7</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6.5</td> <td>38.5</td> <td>7.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6.5+</td> <td>39</td> <td>7.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>7</td> <td>39.5</td> <td>8</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>7.5</td> <td>40</td> <td>8.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8</td> <td>40.5</td> <td>9</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8.5</td> <td>41</td> <td>9.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8.5+</td> <td>41.5</td> <td>9.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>9</td> <td>42</td> <td>10</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>9.5</td> <td>42.5</td> <td>10.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10</td> <td>43</td> <td>11</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10.5</td> <td>43.5</td> <td>11.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10.5+</td> <td>44</td> <td>11.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>11</td> <td>44.5</td> <td>12</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>11.5</td> <td>45</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12</td> <td>45.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12.5</td> <td>46</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12.5+</td> <td>46.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>13</td> <td>47</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>13.5</td> <td>47.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> </tbody> </table> </div>","LSP-0016-35","165.0000","132.0000","1.5000","Climbing","Climbing, Shoes, Basic, Performance, Shoes, La Sportiva, Trifecta Sale","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0016_1.jpg","18","1","1","La Sportiva Miura Lace-up Climbing Shoe",,,"4","2","1","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0016_1.jpg","La Sportiva Miura Lace-up Climbing Shoe","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0016_1.jpg","La Sportiva Miura Lace-up Climbing Shoe","la-sportiva-miura-lace-up-climbing-shoe",,"Shoe Size","35 EU",,,,,,

"La Sportiva Women's Miura Lace-up Climbing Shoe","la-sportiva-women's-miura-lace-up-climbing-shoe","A high performance shoe for edging control and pocket climbing performance <P>In the line for over 10 years, the Miura is the perfect tool for performance footwork whether it be on slabs, vertical or overhanging steep rock. The high tensioned slingshot rand is tied into the powerhinge on the sole so that when small edges are weighted the shoe stretches in the back half of the shoe and not in the front. This allows you to stick on the smallest edges you can find or imagine! The multi-paneled lining gives you the perfect fit and the speed lacing system laces up in a cinch. <P><LI>WEIGHT: 8.22 oz/223 g <LI>LAST: Women's PD 75 <LI>CONSTRUCTION: Slip Lasted <LI>FIT: Performance w/ High Asymmetry <LI>UPPER: Leather LINING: Dentex <LI>MIDSOLE: 1.1mm LaspoFlex (forefoot only) <LI>SOLE: 4mm Vibram XS Grip ""</LI><div class=""ui-size-chart-table-wrap""> <table class=""sizing_chart data-table"" style=""width: 759px; height: 400px;""><caption>Sizing Chart:</caption> <tbody> <tr class=""cols4""><th>US MEN</th><th>EU</th><th>US WOMEN</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4</td> <td>35.5</td> <td>5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4.5</td> <td>36</td> <td>5.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4.5+</td> <td>36.5</td> <td>5.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>5</td> <td>37</td> <td>6</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>5.5</td> <td>37.5</td> <td>6.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6</td> <td>38</td> <td>7</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6.5</td> <td>38.5</td> <td>7.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6.5+</td> <td>39</td> <td>7.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>7</td> <td>39.5</td> <td>8</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>7.5</td> <td>40</td> <td>8.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8</td> <td>40.5</td> <td>9</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8.5</td> <td>41</td> <td>9.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8.5+</td> <td>41.5</td> <td>9.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>9</td> <td>42</td> <td>10</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>9.5</td> <td>42.5</td> <td>10.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10</td> <td>43</td> <td>11</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10.5</td> <td>43.5</td> <td>11.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10.5+</td> <td>44</td> <td>11.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>11</td> <td>44.5</td> <td>12</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>11.5</td> <td>45</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12</td> <td>45.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12.5</td> <td>46</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12.5+</td> <td>46.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>13</td> <td>47</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>13.5</td> <td>47.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> </tbody> </table> </div>","LSP-0017-34","165.0000","132.0000","1.5000","Climbing","Climbing, Shoes, Performance, Shoes, Shoes, La Sportiva, Trifecta Sale","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0017_1.jpg","18","1","1","La Sportiva Women's Miura Lace-up Climbing Shoe",,,"4","2","1","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0017_1.jpg","La Sportiva Women's Miura Lace-up Climbing Shoe","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0017_1.jpg","La Sportiva Women's Miura Lace-up Climbing Shoe","la-sportiva-women-s-miura-lace-up-climbing-shoe",,"Shoe Size","34 EU",,,,,,

"La Sportiva Miura VS Climbing Shoe","la-sportiva-miura-vs-climbing-shoe","<p>The La Sportiva Miura VS Climbing Shoe is a slightly more down turned and aggressive brother to the lace version. It also has the unique P3 technology which helps keep the shape of down turn. It offers many of the same features of the Miura lace-up including the Vibram XS Grip rubber and a sling shot rand. If you want serious power combined with sensitivity and incredible edging - the La Sportiva Miura VS Climbing Shoe is a great place to turn.</p> <ul> <li>COLOR: Yellow/Black</li> <li>UPPER: Leather</li> <li>CONSTRUCTION: Slip Lasted</li> <li>LAST: PD75</li> <li>LINING: Sentex, unlined underfoot</li> <li>SOLE: 4mm Vibram XS Grip</li> <li>MIDSOLE: 1.1mm Laspoflex</li> <li>WEIGHT: 9.52 oz/270 gm "" </li> </ul> <div class=""ui-size-chart-table-wrap""> <table class=""sizing_chart data-table"" style=""width: 759px; height: 400px;""><caption>Sizing Chart:</caption> <tbody> <tr class=""cols4""><th>US MEN</th><th>EU</th><th>US WOMEN</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4</td> <td>35.5</td> <td>5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4.5</td> <td>36</td> <td>5.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4.5+</td> <td>36.5</td> <td>5.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>5</td> <td>37</td> <td>6</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>5.5</td> <td>37.5</td> <td>6.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6</td> <td>38</td> <td>7</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6.5</td> <td>38.5</td> <td>7.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6.5+</td> <td>39</td> <td>7.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>7</td> <td>39.5</td> <td>8</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>7.5</td> <td>40</td> <td>8.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8</td> <td>40.5</td> <td>9</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8.5</td> <td>41</td> <td>9.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8.5+</td> <td>41.5</td> <td>9.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>9</td> <td>42</td> <td>10</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>9.5</td> <td>42.5</td> <td>10.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10</td> <td>43</td> <td>11</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10.5</td> <td>43.5</td> <td>11.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10.5+</td> <td>44</td> <td>11.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>11</td> <td>44.5</td> <td>12</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>11.5</td> <td>45</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12</td> <td>45.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12.5</td> <td>46</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12.5+</td> <td>46.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>13</td> <td>47</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>13.5</td> <td>47.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> </tbody> </table> </div>","LSP-0018-33","175.0000",,"1.5000","Climbing","Climbing, Shoes, Performance, Shoes, Shoes, La Sportiva, Trifecta Sale","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0018_1.jpg","18","1","1","La Sportiva Miura VS Climbing Shoe",,,"4","2","1","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0018_1.jpg","La Sportiva Miura VS Climbing Shoe","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0018_1.jpg","La Sportiva Miura VS Climbing Shoe","la-sportiva-miura-vs-climbing-shoe",,"Shoe Size","33 EU ",,,,,,

"La Sportiva Mythos Climbing Shoe","la-sportiva-mythos-climbing-shoe","<p>Long days in the harness call for shoes that will keep the dogs happy for endless pitches throughout the day, the La Sportiva Mythos Climbing Shoe is just the shoe for this and many other situations. This shoe is a true all around performer that will be happy at work on slabby faces, jamming a tiny finger crack, or marching through some technical face climbing six pitches up. This shoe is the choice of many who climb all day every day. The La Sportiva Mythos combines high performance with serious comfort. The Vibram XS Grip rubber will keep things together when the situations get sticky (see what I did there?).

"La Sportiva Nepal EVO GTX Mountain Boot","la-sportiva-nepal-evo-gtx-mountain-boot","The Evolution of the Nepal Extreme has taken hardcore mountaineering boots to another level. The addition of Gore-Tex Duratherm lining makes the boot completely waterproof and warmer for high altitudes and extreme cold along with a new breathable tongue for moisture management. With the addition of the patented 3-D flex ankle system hinge, an intergrated anatomical elastic snow gaiter and the 3.2mm+ silicone impregnated Idro-Perwanger Roughout Leather with sticky rubber rands the Nepal EVO will climb better than ever. The sole has a new tapered HP3 midsole with shock absorbing PU inserts under the heel and the ball of the foot, the new IBS (Impact Brake System) designed exclusively with Vibram to soften impact on hard ground and improve traction.

"La Sportiva TC Pro Climbing Shoe","la-sportiva-tc-pro-climbing-shoe","The ultimate technical big wall free climbing shoe developed in collaboration with Tommy Caldwell <P>Designed to provide powerful, technical edging AND crack climbing prowess without compromising either. This game changing, mid-height edging machine will take you out of a technical thin hands to rattley fingers crack and out on to the diciest dime edges you can find. Thin padding in the ankle and above the toes protects you in the cracks and the patented P3 platform delivers sensitive yet powerful edging abilities. The toes flat fit is perfect for comfortable crack climbing and the ventilated tongue and lateral rand perforations promote air-flow. We worked with Vibram on a new rubber compound that works best for technical edging and developed the XS Edge compound which holds an edge better on sharp micro edges. <P><LI>WEIGHT: 8.71 oz/247 g <LI>LAST: PD 55 <LI>FIT: Tech w/ Medium-High Asymmetry <LI>UPPER: Leather/ Vibram rubber rands <LI>LINING: Unlined (underfoot)/ Sentex/ PU foam/ Airmesh (tongue) <LI>MIDSOLE: P3 with 1.1mm LaspoFlex <LI>SOLE: Vibram XS Edge ""</LI><div class=""ui-size-chart-table-wrap""> <table class=""sizing_chart data-table"" style=""width: 759px; height: 400px;""><caption>Sizing Chart:</caption> <tbody> <tr class=""cols4""><th>US MEN</th><th>EU</th><th>US WOMEN</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4</td> <td>35.5</td> <td>5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4.5</td> <td>36</td> <td>5.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>4.5+</td> <td>36.5</td> <td>5.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>5</td> <td>37</td> <td>6</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>5.5</td> <td>37.5</td> <td>6.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6</td> <td>38</td> <td>7</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6.5</td> <td>38.5</td> <td>7.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>6.5+</td> <td>39</td> <td>7.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>7</td> <td>39.5</td> <td>8</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>7.5</td> <td>40</td> <td>8.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8</td> <td>40.5</td> <td>9</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8.5</td> <td>41</td> <td>9.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>8.5+</td> <td>41.5</td> <td>9.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>9</td> <td>42</td> <td>10</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>9.5</td> <td>42.5</td> <td>10.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10</td> <td>43</td> <td>11</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10.5</td> <td>43.5</td> <td>11.5</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>10.5+</td> <td>44</td> <td>11.5+</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>11</td> <td>44.5</td> <td>12</td> </tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>11.5</td> <td>45</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12</td> <td>45.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12.5</td> <td>46</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>12.5+</td> <td>46.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>13</td> <td>47</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> <tr class=""cols4""> <td>13.5</td> <td>47.5</td> <th>&nbsp;</th></tr> </tbody> </table> </div>","LSP-0027-34","185.0000",,"2.0000","Climbing","Climbing, Shoes, Performance, La Sportiva, Trifecta Sale","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0027_1.jpg","18","1","1","La Sportiva TC Pro Climbing Shoe",,,"4","2","1","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0027_1.jpg","La Sportiva TC Pro Climbing Shoe","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/l/s/lsp-0027_1.jpg","La Sportiva TC Pro Climbing Shoe","la-sportiva-tc-pro-climbing-shoe",,"Shoe Size","34 EU",,,,,,

"La Sportiva Futura Climbing Shoe","la-sportiva-futura-climbing-shoe","<p>The No Edge concept brings your foot closer to the rock for better edging performance, increased sensitivity and more homogeneous wear. An all-synthetic upper does not stretch out and the Fast Lacing System cinches down with a hook and loop closure. The P3 platform gives you the downturned power needed for hard boulder problems. The overall feel of the shoe is lightweight, thin and sensitive for hi-performance bouldering, sport climbing, technical trad climbing and gym climbing.

"Red Chili Corona VCR Climbing Shoe -CLOSEOUT","red-chili-corona-vcr-climbing-shoe-closeout","Sharpened up, more stylish and with a touch more bite, the Corona's tried and tested fit and function are only improved by a slick re-make for this distinctive and hardcore VCR.. Performance is the key to this shoe and featuring a sharp low-profile toe, a killer slingshot heel and bonus toe rubber for super-tech hooking, it's obvious that it performs! For 2010 the midsole is tweaked to give even more sensitivity and feedback while our double VCR straps add in easy 'on and offs' between boulder sends, redpoints, or on belay. A smart new graphic simply enhances this great package. A proven product, the Corona VCR wears with a fit, function and perfor- mance that really works. <P><strong>Features</strong> <P><LI>VCR straps for easy adjustment. <LI>Sharp asymmetric low profile toe. <LI>Bonus rubber over the toe and in the arch for added versatility. <LI>Cool new black / white colourway. <LI>Twin rear pull on tabs. <LI>Super sticky 4.5mm RX2 Red Chili rubber. <LI>Colour: White / Black.

A thoroughbred technical shoe, the Spirit VCR continues to produce a pedigree performance across such a wide range of climbing styles that it's hard to beat.

"Red Chili Habanero Climbing Shoe","red-chili-habanero-climbing-shoe","<p>If the Matador is too sharp and the Corona too soft the Habanero Lace is perfect. The shoe was developed with Markus Bock, one of the strongest sport climbers in the world. Markus focused on the crucial features that helped him climb his hardest Frankenjura projects. Given a straight last shape, your foot-power is pooled to the big toe and the strong mid-sole supports extra traction for nasty pockets. The speed-lace is incredibly comfortable, while super sensitive and precise footwork is what makes this shoe a world class climber's choice. As for a great high-end shoe, the profiled bonus toe rubber is a must-have and a guarantee for pain-free super-tech toe-hooks. The lo-stretch synthetic upper will prevent the shoe from growing and the leather inner sole will stop the wicked side effect of odour contamination typical for synthetic shoes. With these features the Habanero Lace is not only suitable for high-end climbing but also brings great fun for climbs beyond the 7th grade.</p>","RCH-0025-04","132.0000","99.0000","1.8000","Climbing","Climbing, Shoes, Basic, Performance, Shoes, Red Chili ","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/r/c/rch-0025_1.jpg","18","1","1","Red Chili Habanero Climbing Shoe",,,"4","2","1","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/r/c/rch-0025_1.jpg","Red Chili Habanero Climbing Shoe","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/r/c/rch-0025_1.jpg","Red Chili Habanero Climbing Shoe","red-chili-habanero-climbing-shoe",,"Shoe Size","4 UK - 37 EU",,,,,,

"Scarpa Boostic Climbing Shoe","scarpa-boostic-climbing-shoe","<p>The latest in a string of masterpieces by rock shoe designer Heinz Mariacher, the Boostic is a professional tool intended to perform at the highest levels of the sport, in vertical to overhanging terrain where precision toe power and edging is crucial. Because of its stretchable, sock-like upper, the downturned Boostic slips on snugly, and can accommodate a wide variety of foot types for a precise fit. The two hook-and-loop tab closures augment the structural integrity, securing the foot for high power performance, yet simultaneously retaining slipper-like sensitivity for more delicate moves.

"Metolius BRD (Belay/Rappel Device)","metolius-brd-(belayrappel-device)","<P>With the creation of the BRD, we have achieved a simple, safe and bombproof belay / rappel device. The principle behind the BRD is very simple: as the load of a falling climber is applied, the carabiner is pulled into the scientifically engineered rope slots and the rope is squeezed between the carabiner and the BRD. The result is that a tremendous amount of friction is generated, allowing the belayer to easily catch long, hard falls with relatively light hand pressure. For rappelling, the BRD will give you a relatively slow and controlled (and we feel safer) rappel. If the rappel is moving too slowly, you can re-orient the device for a speedier descent. <P>The BRD is both versatile (single or double ropes) and lightweight. The ergonomic horn gives enhanced control while lowering and rappelling. It is easy to operate, has a high strength-to-weight ratio and doesn't kink ropes. With its enormous stopping power and slower, more controlled rappel, we feel the BRD is clearly the safest plate-style device that has been made.

And the amount of friction can be completely adjusted to suit your particular need. Does your climber outweigh you? Are you using skinny ropes? Then set up the brake line through the V-Slots! Clipping in short (into the oblong hole in the center of the stem) adds even more braking power. <P>Climbing with fat ropes, a skinny partner or on low-angle slabs? Then belay off the U-Grooves for less friction and clip into the bottom hole of the SBGII!

"Metolius Half Dome Haul Bag","metolius-half-dome-haul-bag","Want one haul bag that will last your entire big wall career' You should try the Metolius Durathane Half Dome Haul Bag. This medium size haul bag is ideal for smaller walls or a second bag for huge hauls. The Durathane material is much more abrasion resistant than vinyl-coated nylon found on most other bags. RF welded seams and a comfortable suspension system that tucks away in seconds gives this pig a nice clean profile for hauling. It won't snag on every flake it comes across. The river-bag style closure will keep the weather out of the inside where you'll find gear loops and a zippered pocket for smaller items. On the bottom is a drain hole for any spilled water and a full strength haul point for bringing along other piglets.","MET-0164","219.0000",,"7.4000","Packs & Bags","Packs & Bags, Advanced Climbing, Haulbags, Gear Storage, Metolius ","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/m/e/metolius-half-dome-haul-bag-green.jpg","22","1","0",,"0","2239","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/m/e/metolius-half-dome-haul-bag-green.jpg",,"2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/m/e/metolius-half-dome-haul-bag-green.jpg",,"metolius-half-dome-haul-bag",,,,,,,,,

It has an RF welded main seam, forming a leak-proof seal that is stronger than the fabric itself. It has a double-layer ballistic lid with an internal zippered pocket for quick and easy storage of small items. This bag is well-padded, with a removable back pad and an ergonomically-cut suspension system that tucks away in seconds for hauling. It has virtually indestructible custom aluminum closure buckles, a top compression strap, and offset haul points.</p> </div> <ul> <li>Capacity: 2800 cu. in. (46 L)</li> <li>Weight: 4 lbs. 11 oz.

"Rock Climbing Anchors: A Comprehensive Guide","rock-climbing-anchors:-a-comprehensive-guide","This is a rock climbing instructional book. Climbing anchors allow climbers to safely defy gravity. Solid anchors and proper rope techniques can prevent a fall from turning into a catastrophe, while bad anchors are an accident waiting to happen, says certified guide Craig Luebben, who invented his own type of climbing protection, the Big Bro. Since then, he has taught rock climbing to hundreds of clients and has conducted self-rescue clinics across the United States. He distills more than twenty-five years of experience into ""Rock Climbing Anchors"". This 2007 entry in the ""Mountaineers Outdoor Expert Series"", for intermediate-to-advanced climbers, presents modern anchoring ideas and techniques for top-roping, rappelling, sport climbing, traditional rock climbing, and mountaineering-all in one comprehensive guide. Luebben covers the finer points of all types of commonly used anchors: removable anchors including hexes, wired nuts, tri-cams, expanding wedges, expandable tubes, and cams; natural anchors such as trees and boulders; and fixed anchors like bolts and pitons. Photos show a variety of gear placements, accompanied by discussion of the pros and cons of each.","FAL-0025","19.9500","14.9600","1.2500","Accessories","Accessories, Advanced Climbing, Falcon Guide ","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/f/a/fal-0025_1.jpg","28","1","0","Rock Climbing Anchors: A Comprehensive Guide","0","2238","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/f/a/fal-0025_1.jpg","Rock Climbing Anchors: A Comprehensive Guide","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/f/a/fal-0025_1.jpg","Rock Climbing Anchors: A Comprehensive Guide","rock-climbing-anchors-a-comprehensive-guide",,,,,,,,,

"The Rock Warrior's Way Book - Mental Training for Climbers","the-rock-warrior's-way-book-mental-training-for-climbers","Mental training is scarcely covered in the climbing literature, yet it is as important to performance as strength, flexibility, and technique. In his unique approach to mental training, Arno Ilgner draws essential elements from the rich 'warrior' literature, as well as from sports psychology, and combines these with his extensive climbing experience to create The Rock Warrior`s Way. Here is a comprehensive program for learning how to focus your mental resources during a challenging climb. It includes step-by-step guidance on motivation analysis, information gathering, risk assessment, mental focus, and deliberate transition into action. Poor use of attention creates fear, which can manifest itself as anything from performance anxiety to sheer terror. By using attention more purposefully we can understand how fear is created, deal with it effectively, and free ourselves to get back in touch with a far more powerful motivating force--our love of climbing. We can then create the kind of unbending intention that leads to outstanding performance. The Rock Warrior`s Way is a revolutionary program for climbers who want to improve both their performance and their enjoyment of climbing.","FAL-0066","18.9500","14.2100","0.5000","Climbing","Climbing, Essentials, Accessories, Falcon Guide ","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/f/a/fal-0066_1.jpg","28","1","0","The Rock Warrior's Way Book - Mental Training for Climbers","0","2238","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/f/a/fal-0066_1.jpg","The Rock Warrior's Way Book - Mental Training for Climbers","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/f/a/fal-0066_1.jpg","The Rock Warrior's Way Book - Mental Training for Climbers","the-rock-warrior-s-way-book-mental-training-for-climbers",,,,,,,,,

"Perfecto","perfecto","Among Mallorca's fragrant almond groves, famed nightclubs and speedo-sporting Eurotourists, limestone cliffs rise straight from the sea like sentinels, their steep pockets beckoning to climbers the world over. A fall means splashing into 80 degree water, drying off and trying again - from the bottom. Some call it climbing in its purest form. Others call it a hell of a way to spend a few weeks. Last season, a small group of climbers traveled to those sea cliffs to learn the intricacies of deep water soloing and to try, unrehearsed, some of the hardest - and most aesthetic - routes in the world. Directed and produced by Mike Call, Perfecto captures the beauty, adrenaline and purity of the Mallorca experience.","VCP-0034","29.9500","14.9800","0.2500","Accessories","Accessories, Advanced Climbing, Vista Cerro Productions ","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/v/c/vcp-0034_1.jpg","28","1","0","Perfecto","0","2238","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/v/c/vcp-0034_1.jpg","Perfecto","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/v/c/vcp-0034_1.jpg","Perfecto","perfecto",,,,,,,,,

"Core - BluRay","core-bluray","Like many ‘climbers’ these days I might spend more time watching climbing movies than actually climbing. I was understandably excited to pop in Chuck Fryberger’s latest offering, Core, to ‘experience’ climbing in the vivid detail only available on Blu-Ray. The picture quality and grade-A camera work is noticeably superior than any other climbing film I have seen, but that just lays the groundwork for the excellent content of this film. Core successfully captures the essence of the sport by showcasing top-end ascents in the various genres of rock climbing. Highlights include Nalle Hukkataival’s V15 Livin’ Large and Kevin Jorgeson’s free solo highballs in the Rocklands of South Africa, Matt Wilder’s first ascent of an R rated 5.14 in the Colorado’s Flatirons, and BJTilden tugging on 5.14+ monos in Wyoming. But the film illustrates that big numbers and ground breaking ascents are not the only thing at the ‘Core’ of climbing. Chuck also weaves the aesthetics of the sport throughout every scene. Just as memorable as the hard climbing is the beauty of the environment itself. It’s hard to say if it’s the climbs or the climbers that play the starring role. The striking features, perfect stone, and the coolest single hold I have ever seen complement the people that give the sport life. The film summarizes with a slow-paced clip of the legendary Fred Nicole climbing on his home turf of Switzerland. Fred’s Yoda-like musings are undeniably humble and sincere, the setting is idyllic, and the route is one of the hardest in the world.

You could call it preprogrammed chaos or the beginning of a joint vision. After almost two years of work the film is finished, the result is pure soul !

The locations were Ticino, Magic Wood and the Silvretta Mountains. Each area has its own character, its own style and ambiance. The best and most beautiful first climbs of Bernd Zangerl are documented on film as well as spectacular high balls and low water soloing. 60 minutes.

"Metolius Curve Nut Size 3 BLEM","metolius-curve-nut-size-3-blem","<p><span>Nuts with curved faces have long been the standard in passive protection. The curved faces provide 3 points of contact with the rock, which make the nuts more stable as well as more versatile than older, straight-sided nut designs. However, existing curved nut designs have been limited by the available technology. Metolius has been working to perfect CNC machining to the point that we can sculpt almost any shape we want from metal. This has allowed them to optimize the shape of the nut and orient the curve from side to side rather than top to bottom. The Metolius Curve Nut shape offers all the advantages of existing curved nut designs (3 points of contact), but it is naturally more stable in flares, and because they have a straight taper from top to bottom, it is much easier to judge placement quality.</span></p> <p><strong>FEATURES:</strong></p> <ul> <li>By attaching the cable directly to the nut and eliminating the swage Metolius has made these 30% lighter than the competition</li> <li>Anodized heads are color-coded for easy differentiation</li> <li>Combines the stability of 3-point contact with the ease of a straight-sided taper</li> <li>CNC technology for optimized shape</li> <li>Side-to-side curve for greater stability in flaring placements</li> <li>Straight-sided taper makes it easy to judge placement quality.</li> <li>CNC machined from 6061-T6 billet aluminum</li> <li>CE certified</li> </ul> <p>We are often asked what a BLEM is.

"Black Diamond B.D.V Hoody - CLOSEOUT","black-diamond-b.d.v-hoody-closeout","<p>Over a decade ago, we introduced Black Diamond Verticals, a collection of climbing clothing that included the legendary Alpine Shirt. Inspired by that classic design, the B.D.V. Hoody is a highly dynamic yet protective layer that's as effective during blustery days at the crag as it is on alpine ridge scrambles.

"DMM Alpha Sport Pro Straight Gate Carabiner - Red","dmm-alpha-sport-pro-straight-gate-carabiner-red","<p>We believe the Alpha Pro is the ultimate solid gate, sport climbing biner. And here&rsquo;s why:<br /> If you do a lot of sport climbing a solid gate design makes sense. Bolt hangers can be very unforgiving of lightweight biners, particularly if you are dogging about and taking repeated redpoint falls.</p> <p>The Alpha Pro is robust and strong enough to cope with the typical sport climbing scenarios, but what really makes it stand out from the crowd is its exceptional handling qualities.<br /> The distinctive shape of the carabiner is no accident. The kinked back bone and grippy groove pattern on the apex of the spine are there for a reason. These biners are very easy to handle &ndash; something we are certain you will appreciate when stretching up to make that just-in-reach, gripper clip.</p> <table class=""tech_info_table"" style=""width: 612px; height: 93px;""> <tbody> <tr><th>Variant</th><th>Strength (Gate Closed)</th><th>Strength (Gate Open)</th><th>Strength (Minor Axis)</th><th>Gate Opening</th><th>Weight</th><th>Cat no</th></tr> <tr> <td>Alpha Pro</td> <td>24kN</td> <td>9kN</td> <td>8kN</td> <td>22mm</td> <td>44g</td> <td>A521</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>-</td> <td>-</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>","DMM-0228","12.5000","9.3800","0.5000","Carabiners","Carabiners, Non-Locking, DMM ","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_alpha_pro_straight_gate_carabiner_-_red.jpg","19","1","0","DMM Alpha Pro Straight Gate Carabiner - Red","0","2230","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_alpha_pro_straight_gate_carabiner_-_red.jpg","DMM Alpha Pro Straight Gate Carabiner - Red","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_alpha_pro_straight_gate_carabiner_-_red.jpg","DMM Alpha Pro Straight Gate Carabiner - Red","dmm-alpha-pro-straight-gate-carabiner-red",,,,,,,,,
"DMM Alpha Sport Pro Bent Gate Carabiner - Red","dmm-alpha-sport-pro-bent-gate-carabiner-red","<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if, in that heart-in-mouth grip-clip moment, you knew that at least the quickdraw was on your side?</p> <p>When we designed the Alpha Clip we were determined to produce the most &lsquo;clip friendly&rsquo; biner ever made. The bent gate, with its flared-out barrel shape works in perfect harmony with the kinked and groove-patterned back bar. It just feels so right, handles so well, and most importantly the rope always goes in first time. Try it out and you&rsquo;ll see what we mean.</p> <p>The Alpha Clip is available as the Alpha Sport Quickdraw. This combines the Alpha Pro at the bolt/peg end and the Alpha Clip left to handle the rope.</p> <p>A sport quickdraw can get a lot of abuse, particularly on redpoints where repeated falls are taken; with this in mind we made a robust sling section to suit the situation. The 26mm variable width nylon gives the perfect set up. It is easy to grab if you are bolt-to-bolting your way up to the belay during a redpoint practice session. The sling also tapers down to a neat 16mm ensuring it sits securely in the crook of the biner and always loads correctly.</p> <table class=""tech_info_table""> <tbody> <tr><th>Variant</th><th>Strength (Gate Closed)</th><th>Strength (Gate Open)</th><th>Strength (Minor Axis)</th><th>Gate Opening</th><th>Weight</th><th>Cat no</th></tr> <tr> <td>Alpha Clip</td> <td>24kN</td> <td>9kN</td> <td>8kN</td> <td>25mm</td> <td>45g</td> <td>A526</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>","DMM-0229","12.5000","9.3800","0.5000","Carabiners","Carabiners, Non-Locking, DMM ","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_alpha_clip_bent_gate_carabiner_-_red.jpg","19","1","0","DMM Alpha Clip Bent Gate Carabiner - Red","0","2230","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_alpha_clip_bent_gate_carabiner_-_red.jpg","DMM Alpha Clip Bent Gate Carabiner - Red","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_alpha_clip_bent_gate_carabiner_-_red.jpg","DMM Alpha Clip Bent Gate Carabiner - Red","dmm-alpha-clip-bent-gate-carabiner-red",,,,,,,,,

Some climbers use them exclusively, while others mix and match, racking gear on both the harness gear loops and the Bandolier.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">If you think about it, there are some distinct advantages; on constricted crack or groove pitches the rack can be swept out of the way, allowing you to continue squirming upwards without the hassle of snagging.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">It allows for quick change-overs if you are swinging leads on a multi-pitch route. It also can be jettisoned in an emergency &ndash; for example if you are swept into the sea by a rogue wave while traversing the base of a sea cliff.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The additional gear loops allow you to distribute and organise your rack.

"DMM Brass Offset Nuts","dmm-brass-offset-nuts","<p>Think of your rack as a box of magical tricks designed to help you tame even the trickiest of climbs. When the going gets tough Brass Offsets are one of the best tricks you can try.</p> <p>Imagine the situation: high on a test piece route you grind to a halt, miles out from the last decent runner. It&rsquo;s time to contemplate your next move. The rock in front of you presents no normal runner placements, all that you have to play with are narrow, shallow cracks, the type that happen to be slightly flared too.</p> <p>You have seen other climbers turn tail and make a cowering retreat from this very point, but you find some placements for your trusty offsets. Once they are clipped, off you go forging a line to the top of the route, each upward step given a confidence boost by those magic little nuts glinting in the sun.</p> <p>Okay, so that is quite a fanciful story, but if truth be told most cracks are actually flared.

The big burly top bar is contrasted by our signature I-Beam construction on the non-rope bearing surfaces resulting in a total weight of 72g.</span></p> <h3><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Features</span></h3> <ul class=""features""> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Durable belay biner</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Prevents cross-loading with certain assisted locking belay devices</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Full cross-section top bar for greater wear resistance and smooth belaying</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">High strength, compact size, low weight</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Available with Screwgate, Quicklock, and Locksafe locking systems</span></li> </ul> <table class=""tech_info_table""> <tbody> <tr><th>Variant</th><th>Strength (Gate Closed)</th><th>Strength (Gate Open)</th><th>Strength (Minor Axis)</th><th>Gate Opening</th><th>Weight</th><th>Cat no</th></tr> <tr> <td>Rhino Screwgate</td> <td>27 kN</td> <td>7 kN</td> <td>9 kN</td> <td>20 mm</td> <td>72 g</td> <td>A542</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rhino Quicklock</td> <td>27 kN</td> <td>7 kN</td> <td>9 kN</td> <td>19 mm</td> <td>80 g</td> <td>A543</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rhino Locksafe</td> <td>27 kN</td> <td>7 kN</td> <td>9 kN</td> <td>19mm</td> <td>80 g</td> <td>A547</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>","DMM-0244","23.9500","17.9600","0.5000","Carabiners","Carabiners, Locking, DMM ","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_rhino_locksafe_carabiner.jpg","19","1","0","DMM Rhino Locksafe Carabiner","0","2230","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_rhino_locksafe_carabiner.jpg","DMM Rhino Locksafe Carabiner","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_rhino_locksafe_carabiner.jpg","DMM Rhino Locksafe Carabiner","dmm-rhino-locksafe-carabiner",,,,,,,,,

"DMM Ultra Oval Straight Carabiner","dmm-ultra-oval-straight-carabiner","<p>At first sight the Ultra O looks like a historical remnant from 1970s (think: aid climbing, Yosemite Camp 4, bandanas and white flares).</p> <p>Nostalgia is great but, we haven&rsquo;t made these oval straight gates out of any desire to relive times past. The Ultra O is a very practical biner that works exceptionally well in pulley systems (locking versions are also available for added security). It also has hot forged, I Beam panels to maximise the strength &ndash; weight balance of the biner.</p> <p>Despite these practical advantages, most climbers will see it as the perfect racking biner. It can hold a large number of wires without the awkward bunching that tends to happen with a conventional asymmetric biner. The oval shape also means that the wires will slide round easily without snagging.</p> <h3>Features</h3> <ul class=""features""> <li>Clean nose oval straight gate biner</li> <li>Strong and lightweight I-Beam construction</li> <li>Very generous 9.75mm rope radius</li> <li>Works well in pulley systems</li> <li>Excellent aid climbing biner</li> <li>Perfect racking biner</li> </ul> <table class=""tech_info_table""> <tbody> <tr><th>Variant</th><th>Strength (Gate Closed)</th><th>Strength (Gate Open)</th><th>Strength (Minor Axis)</th><th>Gate Opening</th><th>Weight</th><th>Cat no</th></tr> <tr> <td>Ultra O</td> <td>25kN</td> <td>7kN</td> <td>12kN</td> <td>24mm</td> <td>61g</td> <td>A321</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>","DMM-0373","11.9500","8.9600","0.0800","Non-Locking","Non-Locking","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_ultra_oval_straight_carabiner.jpg","19","1","0","DMM Ultra Oval Straight Carabiner","0","2230","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_ultra_oval_straight_carabiner.jpg","DMM Ultra Oval Straight Carabiner","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/d/m/dmm_ultra_oval_straight_carabiner.jpg","DMM Ultra Oval Straight Carabiner","dmm-ultra-oval-straight-carabiner",,,,,,,,,

"Tenaya Oasi Climbing Shoe","tenaya-oasi-climbing-shoe","<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: 17px;"">Designed to achieve the highest levels of performance, the Oasi is exceptionally comfortable yet offers incredible precision and responsiveness, making rock climbing feel easier and more intuitive. <br /> Our team of engineers and designers has been working on the Oasi project for two years, searching for the perfect rock shoe for extreme climbing.<br /> <br /> The shoe offers exceptional performance across a wide range of climbing disciplines, from bouldering on tiny edges and friction-slopers to long endurance pitches on overhanging walls. <br /> <br /> The Oasi has been created using the MRRB system (Maximum Range in Response and Balance), a new technology developed by Tenaya, which favours a dynamic response and perfect balance, leading to superior performance in all kinds of testing situations. <br /> As with other Tenaya models, the Oasi features SXRDynamics, a moving tightening system incorporating design elements in the sole and structure of the shoe. However, in the Oasi we have taken this one step further with our state of the art Draxtor &mdash; the fastest, most efficient and precise lacing system in the market today. <br /> The Oasi also features a powerful heel, providing optimum comfort and stability, while delivering excellent heel-hooking capabilities. <br /> <br /> In the Oasi, state of the art technology combined with meticulous attention to detail proves that high performance and high comfort are possible in the same shoe, resulting in total connection between the climber and the rock. </span></p> <p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: 17px;""><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><strong>Material:</strong></span><span style=""line-height: 17px;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""line-height: 17px;"">Microfiber<br /> </span><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><strong>Colour:</strong>&nbsp;White and Blue<br /> <strong>Fastener:</strong>&nbsp;Velcro, Draxtor PAT system<br /> </span><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><strong>Tongue:</strong></span><span style=""line-height: 17px;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""line-height: 17px;"">Lycra with two perforated layers</span><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><br /> <strong>Lining:</strong>&nbsp;Cotton with TXT treatment<br /> </span><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><strong>Midsole:</strong></span><strong style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;"">&nbsp;</strong><span style=""line-height: 17px;"">Double midsole GI 1.8 y TST 150</span><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><br /> <strong>Insole:</strong>&nbsp;2D multi-layer strech tex<br /> <strong>Outsole:</strong>&nbsp;Vibram XS Grip 3.5 mm.<br /> <strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;340 grs.</span></span></p>","TNY-0001-04","165.0000","123.7500","1.8000","Shoes","Shoes, Performance","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/t/e/tenaya_oasi_climbing_shoe_2.jpg","18","1","1","Tenaya Oasi Climbing Shoe",,,"4","2","1","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/t/e/tenaya_oasi_climbing_shoe_2.jpg","Tenaya Oasi Climbing Shoe","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/t/e/tenaya_oasi_climbing_shoe_2.jpg","Tenaya Oasi Climbing Shoe","tenaya-oasi-climbing-shoe-13c89c",,"Shoe Size","4 US M - 35.5 EU",,,,,,

Never before has a rock shoe offered such versatile performance in extreme situations. Its ability to stick on &lsquo;impossible&rsquo; holds borders on the supernatural.<br /> <br /> Utilizing the RB RangeX system, a technology developed by Tenaya to make climbing feel both easier and more intuitive, the Tarifa offers superlative responsiveness in all kinds of demanding situations.<br /> <br /> Not too rigid, not too soft, the Tarifa has been designed to provide optimal performance across a wide range of extreme climbing situations: from one-move boulder problems to long, sustained stamina-fests: from the steepest, most powerful overhangs to the thinnest of face climbs: from the tiniest edge to the vaguest smear.<br /> <br /> You&rsquo;ll be amazed how such a radically down-curved shoe can feel so comfortable, more so than many conventionally shaped rock shoes. The answer lies in how the Tarifa works in perfect harmony with the natural biomechanics of your feet, meaning the only thing you have to think about is the next move. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=""TabbedPanelsContent TabbedPanelsContentVisible"" style=""display: block;""> <p><span style=""font-size: medium; color: #000000;""><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><strong><span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Material:</span></strong></span><span style=""line-height: 17px;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""line-height: 17px; font-family: Verdana;"">Microfiber<br /> </span><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><strong><span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Colour:</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">White and Yellow<br /> </span><strong><span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Fastener:</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Lace-up system<br /> </span></span><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><strong><span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Tongue:</span></strong></span><span style=""line-height: 17px;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""line-height: 17px; font-family: Verdana;"">Lycra bidirectional with two layers</span><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana;""><br /> </span><strong><span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Lining:</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Cotton with TXT treatment<br /> </span></span><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><strong><span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Midsole:</span></strong></span><strong style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=""line-height: 17px; font-family: Verdana;"">Double midsole GI 1.8 y TST 150</span><span style=""line-height: 17px;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana;""><br /> </span><strong><span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Insole:</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">2D multi-layer strech tex<br /> </span><strong><span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Outsole:</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Vibram XS Grip 3.5 mm.<br /> </span><strong><span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">Weight:</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: Verdana;"">340 grs.</span></span></span></p> </div>","TNY-0003-045","165.0000","123.7500","1.8000","Shoes","Shoes, Basic, Performance","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/t/e/tenaya_tarifa_climbing_shoe.jpg","18","1","1","Tenaya Tarifa Climbing Shoe",,,"4","2","1","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/t/e/tenaya_tarifa_climbing_shoe.jpg","Tenaya Tarifa Climbing Shoe","2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/t/e/tenaya_tarifa_climbing_shoe.jpg","Tenaya Tarifa Climbing Shoe","tenaya-tarifa-climbing-shoe",,"Shoe Size","4.5 US M - 36 EU",,,,,,

"CAMP Matik Belay Device","camp-matik-belay-device","<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The assisted braking action of the Matik derives from an innovative camming design that&nbsp;makes the device safer and easier on the climber, the belayer, the anchor and the rope.&nbsp;Instead of using a blunt angle to pinch the rope abruptly when the cam is engaged, the&nbsp;Matik is built so the cam rotates in and comes in line alongside rope before it captures the&nbsp;rope completely. This alignment allows a much larger contact area between the cam and&nbsp;the rope (this makes the device more rope friendly than other auto-blocking devices), and&nbsp;the slight amount of slippage that occurs as the cam rotates into place reduce the impact&nbsp;force of a fall. This means less force on the bodies of the climber and belayer, and on the&nbsp;anchor! When lowering, the proprietary Anti-Panic system helps prevent one of the most&nbsp;common accidents occurring with the use of an auto-blocking device &mdash; losing control of&nbsp;the descent. The brake lever will automatically disengage causing the cam to automatically&nbsp;reengage if it is opened too quickly or if it is kept too far open where the speed of the&nbsp;descent can become unmanageable. This unique safety feature is particularly useful where&nbsp;there is little friction from rope drag between the belayer and the climber or during topdown&nbsp;descents where the Matik really delivers an unparalleled sense of safety and control.&nbsp;Users will also instantly notice that the Matik creates a very natural path for the rope&nbsp;that does not require looping or twisting of the rope during descent. Combined with the&nbsp;dynamic camming action that limits the impact of the fall, this more natural rope path helps&nbsp;to reduce wear and tear on the rope. Other distinguishing features of the Matik include a&nbsp;better method for inserting the rope that eliminates the possibility of clipping a carabiner to&nbsp;the device until it is completely closed.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""> NOTE: The assisted braking capability of the Matik does not relieve belayers of the need to&nbsp;adhere to the basic principles of belaying and rappelling. It is imperative to be attentive to&nbsp;the climber&rsquo;s progress and always keep control of the brake line.</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">A revolutionary belay-descender device with assisted braking that delivers unparalleled&nbsp;safety and control</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Gradual camming action reduces the impact force of a fall and decreases wear and tear&nbsp;on the rope</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Proprietary Anti-Panic system automatically blocks the rope if the user loses control of&nbsp;the descent</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Double-hinged lever and straight rope path make the descent feel very fluid and&nbsp;controlled</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Intuitive design eliminates the possibility of clipping a carabiner to the device if it is not&nbsp;completely closed</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Wide attachment hole allows the carabiner to rotate through the hole</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">High-end manufacturing with hot-forged aluminum main body and precision-cast&nbsp;stainless steel for the critical components that come in contact with the rope</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">For single dynamic ropes from 8.6 to 10.2 mm</span></li> </ul> <h5><span style=""font-size: medium;"">WEIGHT</span></h5> <p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">276 g, 9.7 oz</span></p> <h5><span style=""font-size: medium;"">SPECS</span></h5> <p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">ID: 1041</span><br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""> Rope&nbsp;Diameter Min (mm): 8.6</span><br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""> Rope&nbsp;Diameter Max (mm): Single 10.2</span><br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""> CE: Yes</span><br /><span style=""font-size: medium;""> UIAA: Yes</span></p>","CMP-0230","199.9500","149.9600","0.6000","Belay/Rappel","Belay/Rappel","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/c/a/camp_matik_belay_device.jpg","25","1","0",,"0","930","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/c/a/camp_matik_belay_device.jpg",,"2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/c/a/camp_matik_belay_device.jpg",,"camp-matik-belay-device",,,,,,,,,

"Rock Exotica Omni-Block Single 2.6"" Pulley","rock-exotica-omni-block-single-2.6""-pulley","<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The Omni-Block combines a swivel and pulley into one tool, and incorporates a unique sideplate that opens while the pulley is still attached to the anchor. Traditionally, a pulley is connected to a swivel by a carabiner. However, the Omni eliminates the need for the carabiner, reducing length and pieces of equipment in the rigging system. The short length of the Omni is important when used in high-angle, confined space or other space-sensitive rigging environments. The reduced weight of the Omni will make hauling your gear easier. Additionally the Omni sideplate can be opened without detaching from the carabiner. Traditional pulleys require removing from the carabiner to change the rope. With the Omni, the user is able to do this while the pulley is still secured.</span></p> <ul> <ul> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Install and remove rope while still connected to the anchor</span></li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Sideplate locks with two-stage, double-catch safety mechanism</span></li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Integrated swivel allows pulley to orient while reducing gain</span></li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <ul> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Connect, install and remove rope with one hand</span></li> </ul> </ul> <ul> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">CNC machined for optimal weight &amp; strength</span></li> <li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">2.6"" Single<span>&nbsp;&ndash; 1.9 lbs (850gm) | 80kN | 20kN | .5"" (13mm) | CE</span></span></li> </ul>","REX-0051","73.9500",,"0.3000","Pulleys & Rigging","Pulleys & Rigging, Pulley","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/r/o/rock_exotica_omni-block_single_2.6_pulley.jpg","28","1","0",,"0","2246","4","2","0","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/r/o/rock_exotica_omni-block_single_2.6_pulley.jpg",,"2","https://gearexpress.com/media/catalog/product/r/o/rock_exotica_omni-block_single_2.6_pulley.jpg",,"rock-exotica-omni-block-single-2-6-pulley",,,,,,,,,

"Black Diamond Women's Momentum Harness","black-diamond-women's-momentum-harness","<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">For all-around female climbers who know that time spent fiddling with leg loops and adjusting a pinching waistbelt is time wasted, the Women's Black Diamond Momentum Harness delivers a time-saving design for all styles of climbing. A pre-threaded Speed Adjust waistbelt buckle saves time and eliminates error when tying in, while Dual Core Construction&trade; puts an emphasis on comfort, even when you&rsquo;re posted up at a hanging belay.
